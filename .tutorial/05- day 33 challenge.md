# ðŸ‘‰ Day 33 Challenge

Create your own to do list manager. (This can be super useful!)

- Ask the user whether they want to view, add, or edit their to do list.
- If they want to view it, `print` it out in a nice way (Hint: subroutine).
- If they choose to add an item to the to do list, allow them to type in the item and then add it to the bottom of the list.
- If they want to edit the to do list, ask them which item they completed, and remove it from the list.
- Don't worry about duplicates!
- The first item you put in the list should be the first item you remove.
- Add a title, some color, alignment to the text, or emojis. Show off your skills!

Example:
```
To Do List Manager:
Do you want to view, add, or edit your to do list?

- Import libraries first. What libraries will allow you to clear your code and pause it?
- Remember, your list name needs to come before any subroutines or lists.
- Create a subroutine very similar to the one we looked at in the common errors section.
- Add a `while True` loop with `if` statements that allow the user to add, edit, or view their to do list.
- Also, remember what we did to fix the second common error related to removing an item that is not in the to do list. (a nested `if` statement)
- End with pausing and clearing your code.
